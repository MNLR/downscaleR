\usage{
quickDiagnostics(obs, sim, downscaled = NULL, location = c(-42.5, -3),
  type = c("daily", "interannual"), members = NULL, na.tolerance = 0.3,
  ylim = NULL, col.pal = cm.colors(10), main = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{obs}{grid of observations.}

\item{sim}{grid of model data.}

\item{downscaled}{Optional. grid of the downscaling output.}

\item{location}{Coordinates of a location in the geographic domain of the grid.}

\item{type}{Character value, either \code{"daily"} or \code{"interannual"}, indicating is the assessment is to
be performed on a daily or interannual basis.}

\item{members}{An integer vector indicating \strong{the position} of the members to be subset.}

\item{na.tolerance}{proportion of NAs in a grid cell (location) that are allowed to calculate correlation.}

\item{ylim}{'ylim' argument passed to the time series plot.}

\item{main}{'main' argument passed to the plot.}
}
\value{
Two diagnostic plots with observed, simulated and (possibly) downscaled time series, and a QQ-plot by percentlies.
